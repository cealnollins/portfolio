<h1>Neal's Favorite Shows</h1>
<h2>My top 3 shows of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>Who could go wrong with vikings, there is tons of battle scenes great characters and some actual history sprinkled in. Overall its a great show and ive seen it many times.</p>
<h3> The Mandalorian</h3>
<p>In a galaxy far far away you can find both a kick ass and wholesome show for all ages. Starwars fans finally got a great show that made them forget about the sequals they have been complaining about for so long.
</p>
<h3>Chainsaw Man</h3>
<p>I had to include atleast one anime in this list and it had to be chainsaw man. Chainsawman is such a good show with character develoment, amazing fight animations, and pure comedy gold.</p>
